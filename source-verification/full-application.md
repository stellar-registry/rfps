We will build:

1. a network of verification services
2. the on-chain, public-infrastructure hub to integrate them all and surface their information
3. a one-time data-ingestion event to process existing, deployed-before-the-SEP wasms and, as able, add verified `(repo, img)` info for each

## Source Verification Services

Following the example already provided in the [SEP precursor discussion](https://github.com/orgs/stellar/discussions/1923), these services will monitor wasms uploaded to Stellar that contain the `(source code, build image)` pair given by the SEP (the full list of possible `contractmetav0` items, which can be combined in a few valid ways, is: `bldimg` / `bldopt` / `source_repo` / `source_rev` / `tarball_url` / `tarball_sha256`). For each such wasm, these services will:

1. Check if the `bldimg` is from a trusted source. For now, this means it must refer to a [SDF-maintained `stellar-cli` container](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-cli).
2. Check that the source code is publicly available and well-formed (meaning there is a `source_rev` that matches the one given). (This proposal only covers open source repositories for now; see the Future Work section outlining a closed-source-with-auditing alternative as outlined in [Chad’s Item \#4 from the SEP precursor discussion](https://github.com/orgs/stellar/discussions/1923#discussioncomment-16882699).)
3. If both of the above are true, pull that container, pull that source code, and run `stellar contract verify` for that source code within that container.
4. Check if the result of `verify` confirms that the given `(source code, build image)` pair do, indeed, result in the `wasm_hash` of the uploaded wasm.
5. Submit the result of this check to Stellar Registry (see below).

## Stellar Registry data hub

Stellar Registry already allows adding names and semantic versions to Stellar wasms, turning the inscrutable trail of wasm hash uploads into a meaningful (and instrumentable) narrative. Once `(source code, build image)` information is added to the wasm metadata, Registry will also expose this data via its contract calls and UI.

Crucially, this information will initially be shown as *unverified*. We will add a `verify_source` contract endpoint, gated to an allow-list of known Source-Verification services (item #1 above). Rather than showing a simple checkmark if a source-verification service confirms a `source code + build image = wasm hash` match, Registry will expose *which* verifiers said *what*. It will surface disagreements, allowing consumers to make their own decision about whether to trust a wasm that is source-verified by some entities but which fails source-verification for others.

Additionally, for wasms that have already been uploaded to Stellar which lack the new `(source code, build image)` data in their `contractmetav0`, Registry will allow adding these fields via the Registry contract. It will then emit an event which can be monitored by Source Verification Services, in addition to wasm uploads, so that their source verification process can run based on both on-chain events.

## Back-verification & corpus (the differentiator)

Verifying fresh, SEP-58-complete contracts is the bare minimum. What really differentiates this proposal is the effort into verifying the **existing deployed corpus**, most of which predates the standard. Because results key on `wasm_hash`, a small number of high-impact blobs cover a large share of activity.

## A Joint Submission

This is a joint submission by **The Aha Company**, **Runtime Verification**, and **Ethan Frey**. The Aha Company will build the Stellar Registry data integration point. Runtime Verification will provide an initial source-verification service. Ethan Frey will is the tech lead and heads the back-verification effort. All aspects, from Aha, RV, and Ethan, will be open source and well-documented, providing the whole ecosystem a solid foundation for 1\. retrieving source-verification information from Stellar Registry and 2\. implementing their own source-verification system, following RV’s example.


# Traction Evidence
> Provide evidence of prior traction or validation. Include users, community size, partnerships, KPIs (TVL...), beta testers to demonstrate adoption, market interest, and project credibility.

## The Aha Company

A Stellar-focused engineering firm with a strong delivery record: major contributions to the Stellar CLI, institutional work bringing Société Générale-Forge's EURCV stablecoin onto Stellar rails, and multiple SCF-funded public goods including Moonlight and Scaffold Stellar. We support ecosystem governance and developer education (largely through hackathons).

This project extends infrastructure we already operate, Stellar Registry, which includes:

* [`stellar-registry-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/stellar-registry-cli) published on crates.io (\~6,400+ all-time downloads).
* Live registry browser at [https://stellar.rgstry.xyz](https://stellar.rgstry.xyz); registry contract on testnet, mainnet rollout underway.
* Active in the SEP-55 / reproducible-builds discussions (\#1573, \#1923), where this registry effort is already flagged.

## Runtime Verification

A leading formal-verification and smart-contract security firm. Founded in 2010 by Grigore Roșu, creator of the K framework, it has since 2018 delivered formal verification and security services to major blockchain foundations and protocols including the Ethereum Foundation, Stellar, EigenLayer, Optimism, Uniswap, Lido, Gnosis, and Morpho. RV maintains widely-used open-source verification tooling such as Kontrol and Simbolik, and its formal-verification engine now powers Immunefi's Magnus security platform. RV also has extensive experience in the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem, having provided high-quality audits to DeFi protocols deploying on Stellar for over 2 years and developed tooling for Soroban like [Komet](https://komet.runtimeverification.com/) for fuzz testing and formal verification. RV will operate an independent verifier node in the network and provide audit-grade trust signals.

## Ethan Frey ([@ethanfrey](https://github.com/ethanfrey))

Creator of CosmWasm, the WebAssembly smart-contract platform that directly inspired Soroban's architecture — Wasm runtime, Rust SDK, host-function model, and contract metadata sections all overlap. Through Confio, the company he founded, and building on earlier work as a contributor to the Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm grew into the dominant smart-contract engine in the Cosmos ecosystem, deployed across 30+ independent app-chains (Osmosis, Neutron, Sei, Injective, Archway, and others) and securing billions in on-chain value. He brings direct prior art for this RFP's hardest problem: he designed and shipped [CosmWasm/optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/optimizer), the deterministic, toolchain-pinned Wasm build image that essentially every CosmWasm contract verification has run through for years and the proven blueprint for this project's Soroban build pipeline, along with the hard-won lessons (`--locked` enforcement, single-architecture determinism) now feeding directly into SEP-58; and he built [cosmwasm-verify](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-verify), a source-verification proof-of-concept (git repo + commit → deployed Wasm hash) that is essentially the centralized version of what this proposal decentralizes for Soroban. As an advisor to [Warp Drive](https://www.warp-drive.xyz), the Stellar port of [WAVS](https://wavs.xyz), he also brings the EigenLayer-style restaked operator network that provides the multi-operator, cryptoeconomically secured attestation layer this proposal depends on. He is actively shaping the live SEP-58 / reproducible-builds design (Stellar discussions [#1923](https://github.com/orgs/stellar/discussions/1923)) and working to standardize architecture deicisions via the SEP-process, like [Stellar Protocol PR #1951](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1951), so this verifier composes with the emerging standard rather than working around it, with all work MIT-licensed and built in the open.

# SCF Build Tranche Deliverables

> Depending on the scope of your project, importance to the ecosystem, and team, you can request up to $150K in XLM for ~6 months to cover costs directly related to development of the product itself with the final goal being to launch on mainnet. Take a close look at the to determine your total budget request.
>
> You should divide your deliverables into 3 main milestones: Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Testnet, and Mainnet.
>
> Your award will be distributed in 3 equivalent tranches. The first upon approval of the submission, the second upon deliverable review of your MVP, and the third when you launch on Mainnet. The testnet tranche will not unlock an XLM award, but will provide you with access to the Stellar LaunchKit where you can apply for credits for audits and infrastructure offers. For each tranche, include estimated dates of completion, and a budget breakdown for each deliverable.
>
> Common issues:
> 1. SCF funding may not be used for marketing or promotion. Do not include these items in your budget.
>
> 2. Audit credits are provided as part of the testnet tranche completion. Audit costs should not be included in your budget.


## Tranche 1 - Requirements gathering

### Deliverable 1: Architecture & specs

- **Brief description:** Architecture documents, SEP proposals (SEP-58 and the verifier-API SEP), and the high-level interoperability specification defining the formats and interfaces between the three parties. 
- **How to measure completion:** A spec everyone can build against.
- **Estimated date of completion:** 3 weeks after signing
- **Budget:** $26,250


## Tranche 2 - Testnet

### Deliverable 1: Verification engine

- **Brief description:** hermetic rebuild engine, signing, and claim submission, tested end-to-end.
- **How to measure completion:** Source info added to Testnet registry, or wasm uploaded to testnet that includes source info, results in processing by Runtime Verification and subsequent submission of verification data to Registry.
- **Estimated date of completion:** 2 weeks after Tranch 1 completion.
- **Budget:** $17,500

### Deliverable 2: Contracts, indexer & query engine

- **Brief description:** Final contract interface & event design; GoldSky indexer; query API.
- **How to measure completion:** Source info added to Testnet registry, or wasm uploaded to testnet that includes source info, results in processing by Runtime Verification and subsequent submission of verification data to Registry, which exposes it via its query API.
- **Estimated date of completion:** 3 weeks after Tranch 1 completion.
- **Budget:** $26,250

## Tranche 3 - Mainnet & corpus back-verification

### Deliverable 1: Integrate & launch on mainnet

- **Brief description:** Connect every component end-to-end and launch on mainnet. SEPs, RFCs, and the API spec are settled; protocols finalized.
- **How to measure completion:** Source info added to mainnet registry, or wasm uploaded to mainnet that includes source info, results in processing by Runtime Verification and subsequent submission of verification data to Registry, which exposes it via its production query API.

### Deliverable 2: Corpus back-verification

- **Brief description:** A significant corpus of existing contracts is recovered and uploaded.
- **How to measure completion:** Tranch 1 will help determine exact fraction of extant-at-SEP-creation contracts to be back-verified. At a minimum:
  - rain-crossmint smart-account/factory wasm, which accounts for 70% of active Soroban mainnet contracts
  - a significant fraction (20%? 50%?) of ~970 wasms that carry both a `cliver` and `rsver`. The final fraction depends on how many of these wasms have a source repository which source can be located.
- **Estimated date of completion:** 3 weeks after Tranch 2 completion.
- **Budget:** $26,250
